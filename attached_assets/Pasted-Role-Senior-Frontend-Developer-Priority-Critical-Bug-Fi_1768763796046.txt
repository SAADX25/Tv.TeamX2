Role: Senior Frontend Developer Priority: Critical Bug Fix (User Profile Section)

The Issue:

Broken Avatar: The profile picture in the bottom user bar is not displaying correctly (broken image icon). This is likely due to an incorrect path or a missing default image fallback.

Missing Effects: The RGB/Animated effect is missing from the username in the bottom bar, even if it is enabled in settings.

UI Interaction: There is no visual feedback (hover/click effects) when interacting with the bottom user section.

The Fix:

Fix Image Path: Check the image src in the bottom bar component. Ensure it points to the correct /uploads/ path or uses the stored URL.

Implement Fallback: If the user hasn't uploaded a photo or the image fails to load, automatically display a default avatar SVG so it never looks broken.

Sync RGB Effect: Ensure the CSS class for the RGB/Gold effect is applied to the username in the bottom bar, not just in the chat messages.

Add Hover Effects: Add a subtle glow or background highlight when hovering over the settings, headphones, and mic icons to make it feel professional.

Action: Debug the UserBar component and fix the avatar display and text effects across the entire UI.

Issue 1: Blurry Images & Content (The Glass Effect is Wrong)

Problem: The backdrop-filter: blur() seems to be affecting the content (images and text), making them look fuzzy/blurred.

Fix: Apply the glass effect strictly to the background layer only (using background-color: rgba(...) with a separate backdrop div or pseudo-element). Ensure user uploaded images and text remain sharp and crisp.

Issue 2: Chat Area is "Shrunken" (Layout Constraint)

Problem: The main Chat Container does not fill the screen width properly. It looks centered with too much empty space on the sides.

Fix:

Set the Main Chat Column to flex-grow: 1 and width: 100%.

Remove any max-width constraints on the chat container (e.g., container, wrapper).

Ensure the layout uses the full available viewport width (100vw) and height (100vh) without unnecessary margins.

Issue 3: Image Quality

Fix: Force uploaded images to render at high quality. Add CSS: image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast (or similar) to prevent downscaling blur.

Ensure uploaded images scale responsively but do not become pixelated.

Action: Refactor the CSS layout to fix the shrinking and remove the blur filter from the content layer immediately
